czero.eqz
czero.eqz rd,rs1,rs2
If rs2 contains the value zero, this instruction writes the value zero to rd. Otherwise, this instruction copies the contents of rs1 to rd. This instruction carries a syntactic dependency from both rs1 and rs2 to rd. Furthermore, if the Zkt extension is implemented, this instruction’s timing is independent of the data values in rs1 and rs2.
